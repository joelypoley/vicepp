# vicepp

The code I'm writing as I follow along with the video series on programming a chess engine from Bluefever software.

I've written it in C++ instead of C so I have some of the convenience of C++ (contstants, std::array, stricter type checking, etc.) but the code looks very similar to the original vice engine and I have kept the variable names the same.
